# Requirements To Use The System 
<ol>
	<li>Confirming the identity of users: By requiring users to provide a unique identifier and password, an authentication system can confirm that a user is who they claim to be.</li>
	<li>Protecting sensitive information: An authentication system can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources, such as financial data, personal information, or confidential business information.</li>
	<li>Maintaining accountability: An authentication system can keep track of who has accessed a system and when, providing a clear audit trail that can be used for compliance purposes or to investigate security incidents.</li>
	<li>Improving security: By using strong passwords and secure authentication methods, an authentication system can help reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches</li>
</ol>

# Development
<p>To develop the user authentication system, the following steps can be taken:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The requirements for the authentication system are defined, including considerations for security, scalability, ease of use, and regulatory compliance.</li>
	<li>An authentication method is selected, such as password-based, multi-factor, or biometric authentication.</li>
	<li>A database to store user information, such as usernames, passwords, and email addresses, is designed.</li>
	<li>The authentication logic is implemented, including code to validate user credentials and grant or deny access to the system.</li>
	<li>The system is thoroughly tested to ensure it functions as expected and meets security and performance requirements.</li>
	<li>The authentication system is deployed to the production environment, taking measures to secure sensitive information.</li>
	<li>The system is regularly monitored for security vulnerabilities and performance issues, with maintenance and updates performed as needed.</li>
</ol>
